# 🚀 ForgeCLI

**Deploy. Scale. Monitor — From Your Terminal.**

ForgeCLI is a cloud-native DevOps and deployment automation CLI that helps developers deploy, monitor, scale, and manage applications directly from the terminal.

Instead of manually handling Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, logs, and infrastructure workflows, developers can use simple commands like:

```bash
forge deploy
forge logs
forge scale
forge monitor
```

ForgeCLI simplifies modern deployment systems through an intuitive terminal-first experience while exposing developers to real-world backend and infrastructure engineering concepts.
